# Lint and strict rules for interface

### Lint
- Hungarian notation was cool in the early 2010
- Nowadays we should not use them
- Making the code harder to understand

### Rules for interfaces by using annotation
- Some times we need to be strict who can and who is required to implement an interface
- We can reach it by using ```Proccessor::class```
